## How I Built This

This project was built with the help of Amazon Q Developer, which assisted in:

1. Generating the initial project structure
2. Creating the fortune database with different categories
3. Implementing the retro UI design with CSS
4. Developing the JavaScript logic for fortune generation and history tracking
5. Adding special effects and animations

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with animations and retro styling)
- JavaScript (vanilla JS, no frameworks)
- LocalStorage for fortune history persistence

## Future Enhancements

- Voice mode: Add a retro "speaking" voice to read fortunes aloud
- "Ask Again" button: Reroll the fortune like a Magic 8-ball
- More easter eggs and rare fortunes
- AI-powered daily horoscope based on user name/birthday
